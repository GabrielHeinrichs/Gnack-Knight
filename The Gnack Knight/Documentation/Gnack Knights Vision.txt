Project Vision Draft:
Phase 1: Regular Play with Grunts
At 00:00 mark, the player will be positioned at the bottom center of the screen
At 00:13 mark, grunts will start spawning in from the top right side of the screen. Then at 00:16 mark, grunts will start spawning in from the top left side of the screen
The grunts will move in a straight line to about ⅓ of the screen then move diagonally towards the middle all the way through
The grunts will spawn and move in this manner once more so a total of four waves of grunts will spawn
These grunts will shoot every half a second once they start moving diagonally
At 00:25 mark, a total of 12 grunts will spawn. They will come from the top of the screen and come out one by one, one after the other
They will shoot once in the direction of the player
At 00:36 mark, a total of 30 grunts will spawn and come from the top of the screen all at once, almost covering the entire top screen
Each grunt will shoot 5 consecutive shots in the direction of the player
At 00:39 mark, grunts will spawn in rows of five from the top of the screen, evenly spaced out and all at once
Each grunt will fire in a star/spread pattern
The grunts will spawn and shoot in this manner two more times with 3 seconds in between spawns
By now, all grunts should be killed or exited the screen
Phase 2: Mid-Boss Attacks
At 00:48 mark, the Mid Boss appears at the top of the screen and slowly moves downward
At 00:52 mark, the Mid Boss stays in place and fires bullets in a asterisk shape
It will move just a bit and fire again in the same pattern once it stops. It will keep doing this
As the Mid Boss moves, it will fire smaller bullets
At 01:15 mark, the Mid Boss should be killed or exited the screen

Phase 3: More Grunts
For 15 seconds, grunts will spawn from the top of the screen in rows of three, shooting in a star/spread pattern
The grunts will spawn and shoot in this manner with three seconds between spawns


Phase 4: Final Boss Attack
At 01:30 mark, the Final Boss appears from the top of the screen, slowly makes its way down towards the middle of the screen and begins its first stage of attack
Stage 1 (01:35 - 02:00): The Final Boss will fire bullets in a lituus shape and as those bullets make their way towards the player, will slowly compress and invert its shape. In between these lituus shape shots, the Final Boss will fire bullets in the shape of a circle twice, one after the other. Repeat.
Stage 2 (02:00 - 03:00): The Final Boss will now fire bullets in the shape of three Cote’s spirals (Case 3) connected together. In between those shots, the Final boss will fire bullets in the shape of a circle twice, one after the other. Repeat.
At 03:00 mark, the boss should be killed or exited the screen
